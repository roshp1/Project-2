# Project-2
Our hypothesis is to create a tactical (short-term) financial model that is able to predict future prices of the Nasdaq 100 Index over the next 10 days.
By making predictions, an investor can use the model to buy (long) or sell (short) the Nasdaq Index via using Index ETFs or Index options (writing calls or puts).
